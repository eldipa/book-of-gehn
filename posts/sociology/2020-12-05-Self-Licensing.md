Doing good things has a "moral boost" on the self-concept, then a person
subconsciously get "self-indulgent" and makes permissive
in the future to do bad actions.

The person no necessary needs to do the good action to have the
"moral boost": she can commit to do it in the future and that is
enough to have the boost.

Even the person does not need to do anything. The boost can be
transferred from a group that the person identify herself
as belonging to.
