[byexample](https://byexamples.github.io/byexample/) is a tool that
reads snippets of code from your documentation, executes them and
compares the obtained results with the expected ones, from your docs
too.

If a mismatch happen we say that the *example* in your documentation
failed which could mean one fo two things:

 - your code (the snippet) does not do what you expect so it has a bug
 - or the code does exactly what it is supposed but you forgot to update
your doc.

*Very useful for testing and keep your docs in sync!*

But [byexample](https://byexamples.github.io/byexample/)
does not really execute anything by itself. Having to code
an interpreter for Ruby, Java, C++ and others would be *insane*.

Instead,
[byexample](https://byexamples.github.io/byexample/)
sends the snippets of code toa standard interpreter like
[IRB](https://github.com/ruby/irb)
for Ruby or
[cling](https://github.com/root-project/cling)
for C++.

Interpreting the output from they is not always trivial.

When a interpreter prints to the terminal, it may write special
[escape/control
sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code),
invisible to human eyes, but interpreted by the terminal.

That's how IRB can tell your terminal to output something with reds and
blues colors.

{% call marginnotes() %}
That's how `byexample`'s
[`+term=ansi`](https://byexamples.github.io/byexample/advanced/terminal-emulation)
is implemented.
{% endcall %}

[byexample](https://byexamples.github.io/byexample/)
has no idea of what the hell those control sequences are and
relays on a *terminal emulator*:
[pyte](https://github.com/selectel/pyte)

{% call mainfig('byexample-pyte-overview.png') %}
`byexample` sends the snippets to the correct interpreter and its output
*feeds* `pyte.Screen`. It is the plain text from the emulated terminal
what `byexample` uses to compare with the expected output from the
example.
{% endcall %}

But `pyte` may take **seconds** to process a single output so `byexample`
never enabled it by default.

This post describes the *why* and *how* of the
[optimizations contributed](https://github.com/byexamples/pyte/tree/Screen-Optimizations)
to `pyte` to go from seconds to **microseconds**.

## Artifacts and artificial boundaries

Using an emulator like `pyte` saves us from interpreting the
[escape/control
sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ansi_escape_code),
but introduces some unwanted artifacts in the output.

For example, considere the following snippet that prints a **single**
line of `"A"`. If you do this in your terminal you will see that the
line **spans multiple lines**.

```python
>>> print("A" * 170)
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAA
```

Why? It's because your terminal has boundaries, a finite width in this
case and lines longer than that are *cut* and *continued* on the next
line.

This is super handy for a human but not for `byexample`.

Another artifact is the limit of lines in the terminal: if the
interpreter outputs a lot of lines only the last will be visible *"on the
screen"* and the rest will be lost.

```python
>>> for i in range(30):
...     print(i)
22
23
24
25
26
27
28
29
```

Again, your terminal has a finite height so the same goes for the `pyte`
emulator.

## The hack

If the size of the emulated screen generates unwanted artifacts, the
hack is simple: increase the size!

And `pyte` has no problem with that.

Well, actually, it has....

## Bad news: it is super slow!

`pyte` implements a sparse buffer so technically it should not have
problems when we increase the size of the screen.

Even if the geometry is of 2400 lines by 8000 columns, the performance
of `pyte` should depend **only** on the amount of non-empty data in the
screen.

Sadly, the algorithms for terminal emulation are **not** *sparse aware*
and they do **full scans**.

To give you an example, if a line of 8000 columns has only 5 characters,
only 5 characters are stored on memory (good) but displaying it iterates
over the whole 8000 columns

```python
>>> @property
>>> def display:
...     for y in range(self.lines):
...         for x in range(self.columns):
...             self.buffer[y][x]  # display the char
```

`pyte` runtime complexity runs *quadratic* with respect the size of the
terminal and not *linear* with respect the real data stored within.

Moreover, the underlying implementation of `buffer` is a `defaultdict`.

While initially it may contain only the real characters and being very
*sparse*, as soon you do a *single full scan* the `buffer` will contain
**all the entries** possible of 2400x8000.

`buffer` will *not* be sparse but completely **dense**. And this of
course means the memory also grows **quadratic**.

## Make `pyte` really fast!

With 54 commits (more than 10% of the total commits that `pyte 0.8.1` has),
the [pull request](https://github.com/byexamples/pyte/tree/Screen-Optimizations)
implements a lot of improvements.

The [TL;DR post](/articles/2022/07/14/TLDR-Screen-Optimizations-Results.html)
with the contributions and the results is posted
somewhere else but here is a summary.

## Sparse-aware scans

First, every time that `pyte` needs to iterate over non-empty lines or
chars, use sparse aware iterations.

Instead of doing:

```python
...     for y in range(self.lines):
...         line = self.buffer[y]
...         for x in range(self.columns):
...             line[x]  # do something
```

Do this:

```python
...     non_empty_y = sorted(self.buffer)
...     for y in non_empty_y:
...         line = self.buffer[y]
...         non_empty_x = sorted(line)
...         for x in non_empty_x:
...             line[x]  # do something
```

Both `buffer` and `line` are `dict` with row indexes/column indexes
as keys for each non-empty line/char respectively.

The full scan with the nested `range` is `s^2`{.mathjax}
in terms of any possible slot in the buffer, empty or not.

In contrast, the sparse-aware variant has the cost
of `sorted` (`n log(n)`{.mathjax}) and the iteration (`n`{.mathjax})
both in terms of the non-empty data.

When the `buffer` is sparse we expect `n â‰ª s`{.mathjax} and the second
code is way faster than the first.

If `buffer` is not sparse, both code are quadratic.

## Sparsity

So it is critical to maintain the sparsity of the `buffer`, not only
because it consumes less memory (less real entries in the `dict`) but
because the runtime of other algorithms depend on that!

Now, in `pyte 0.8.1`, the `buffer` is a `defaultdict` so any *read* may
potentially **write** an entry.

Consider the following `index` method that moves all the lines one row
up so a line at coordinate `y=8` will be moved to `y=7`:

```python
def index():
    # [...]
    bottom, top = 0, self.lines-1
    for y in range(top, bottom):
        self.buffer[y] = self.buffer[y + 1]
    self.buffer.pop(bottom, None)
```

Simple, elegant but.... for each *empty entry* at `y + 1`, we will
creating 2 real entries into the buffer: one for writing into index `y`
and one for reading `y + 1`.

These are what I called **false entries**.

A single call to `index` will turn the `buffer` into a *dense*, full of
false entries `dict`.

The solution is to replace the full scan `for y in range(top, bottom)`
for one that that iterate only the non-empty entries (avoiding then
reading empty entries):

```python
def index():
    # [...]
    bottom, top = 0, self.lines-1
    non_empty_y = sorted(self.buffer)

    self.buffer.pop(top, None)

    to_move = non_empty_y[begin:end]
    for y in to_move:
        self.buffer[y-1] = self.buffer.pop(y)
```

The call to `buffer.pop` removes the entry and the `buffer[y-1] =`
stores it back in the new index avoiding reading or writing any false
entry.

Once all the algorithms are reimplemented, we must change `buffer` from
a `defaultdict` to a `dict` to prevent any accidental false entry.

## Binary searches

When `resize` is called and if the screen shrinks, all the lines of the
screen are truncated to the new width.

```python
def resize(self, lines, columns):
    # [...]
    if columns < self.columns:
        for line in self.buffer.values():
            for x in range(columns, self.columns):
                line.pop(x, None)
    # [...]
```

Popping out all the `x` entries that are greater than the new `columns`
is correct but we can do it better.

You see, most of the entries in the line will not exist really and `pop`
will have no effect on the `line` (except consuming time!).

With a binary search we can find in `log(n)`{.mathjax} the first
non-empty `x` and delete from there.

```python
def resize(self, lines, columns):
    # [...]
    if columns < self.columns:
        for line in self.buffer.values():
            non_empty_x = sorted(line)
            begin = bisect_left(non_empty_x, columns)
            for x in non_empty_x[begin:]:
                line.pop(x)
    # [...]
```

Technically this is still `O(n)`{.mathjax} but it should be iterate over
lesser entries than the former `0.8.1` version.

## The good old Python tricks

At least for `3.10`, Python still does not cache any attribute lookup so
a easy win is to it ourselves, specially with the lookup is in a
`for`-loop:


```python
def resize(self, lines, columns):
    # [...]
    buffer = self.buffer
    if columns < self.columns:
        for line in buffer.values():
            non_empty_x = sorted(line)
            pop - line.pop
            begin = bisect_left(non_empty_x, columns)
            for x in non_empty_x[begin:]:
                pop(x)
    # [...]
```

Now, we have an additional low-hanging fruit: the inner `for`-loop calls
repetitively the same function over a sequence.

Does that ring any bells to you?

Replacing a loop with a `map` moves the loop into C and because
`dict.pop` is in `C` too, it is even faster:

```python
def resize(self, lines, columns):
    # [...]
    buffer = self.buffer
    if columns < self.columns:
        for line in buffer.values():
            non_empty_x = sorted(line)
            pop - line.pop
            begin = bisect_left(non_empty_x, columns)

            list(map(pop, non_empty_x[begin:]))
    # [...]
```

## Don't do what you don't need

`pyte` tracks which lines were modified in a `dirty` set but `byexample`
(and maybe other users) does not need it.

`byexample` *renders* the whole screen as a single string calling
screen.display so it does not care what lines changed or not.

For the same reason emulating things like colores and styles is
pointless.

As part of the optimizations now `pyte` can optionally disable those.


## *"faster"*, but how *much* faster?

All the gory details are in the
[TL;DR post](/articles/2022/07/14/TLDR-Screen-Optimizations-Results.html)
but here is a quick summary:

At minimum, a humble 2 times faster for small geometries but for large
geometries the speed up goes up to 7 times faster and if the screen
is tuned, up to 12 times.

An for `screen.display`, the speed up is insanely huge: 600000 times!
But it has a more modest common case of 10 to 200 times faster.

Memory usage was also optimized from 1.10 and 50 times better.

Not everything was improved however: some test cases had a small
regression and one had up to 5 times slower (boomers) but in general
there was a lot of profit on the improvements.
