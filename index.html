<p>It starts from the very begin, really easy, but it goes up to more
challenging exercises quickly.</p>

and IDSs looking for someone that shouldn’t be there are reasonable and

<p>But when a friend of my opened his browser this week and went to <code class="highlighter-rouge">google.com</code>
the things got odd.</p>

<p>The browser refused the connection warning me that the SSL certificate
of the server wasn’t issue by <code class="highlighter-rouge">google.com</code> at all or signed by a
trusted authority.</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">December 18, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>A friend of mine called me: a girl friend of him was hopeless trying to recover her thesis from a corrupted usb stick <em>three days</em> before her presentation.</p>

<p>She was working in her thesis for almost a year, saving all the progresses in that usb stick. But what she didn’t know was that an usb memory has a limited number of writes and with more writes eventually the file system gets corrupted.</p>

<p>This is the real story behind a forensics rally trying to recover her one year work.</p>
