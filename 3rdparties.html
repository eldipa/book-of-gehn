<h3 id="bit-twiddling-hacks-by-sean-eron-anderson">Bit Twiddling Hacks by Sean Eron Anderson</h3>

<p>A quite
<a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html">large collection of ingenious bit tricks</a>:
counting bits,
reversing sequences, swapping, log/power 2 functions.</p>

<p>Some of them are already implemented by modern compilers so the
performance improvement is marginal but still it is worth reading.</p>

<h3 id="disasters-ive-seen-in-a-microservices-world-by-joão-alves">Disasters I’ve seen in a microservices world by João Alves</h3>

<p>And “I saw them too”, I would like to add. The post enumerates
the <a href="https://world.hey.com/joaoqalves/disasters-i-ve-seen-in-a-microservices-world-a9137a51">dark side of the microservices.</a>.</p>

<p>Today (~2020), microservices are seen as the magic solution where
everyone is happy and the development is easy and fast, nothing like
the old monolithic code.</p>

<p>People confuse microservices with modularity. Most of the benefits
of microservices comes from modularity: low coupling high cohesion.</p>

<p>It is not an exclusive property of microservices. What it is exclusive
(or at least very characteristic of them) is the separation in several
programs, even running in different machines.</p>

<p>This brings a new whole of challenges that most of the developers
(~2020) are not aware of.</p>

<p>Timeouts, retries, too many hops and inconsistent states are a few of
the classic problems that developers must face.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When people started to write services to generate CSVs. Why would
someone introduce network hops to produce a worldwide known file format?
Who would maintain that?
Some teams were suffering from <em>servicitis</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know, I saw that too.</p>

<p>That thing that we call <em>terminal</em> is much more than you think.</p>

<p>The post <a href="http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/index.php">goes deeper in the rabbit
hole</a> and
explores the internals of the TTYs.</p>
